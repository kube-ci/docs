# Workflow

## What is Workflow

A `Workflow` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD). It provides configuration for a set of sequential and/or parallel tasks and conditions for triggering them.

## Workflow Spec

As with all other Kubernetes objects, a Workflow needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields. It also needs a `.spec` section. Below is an example Workflow object:

```yaml
apiVersion: engine.kube.ci/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: sample-workflow
  namespace: default
spec:
  triggers:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    resource: configmaps
    namespace: default
    name: my-config
    onCreateOrUpdate: true
  steps:
  - name: step-01
    image: alpine
    commands:
    - echo
    args:
    - step-one
  - name: step-02
    image: alpine
    commands:
    - echo
    args:
    - step-two
```

The `.spec` section has following parts:

### spec.triggers

Specifies a set of Kubernetes resources along with their events (create/delete/update). The workflow will be triggered for any of those events. A trigger can have following fields to specify resources and filter events:

- `apiVersion` (required): API version of the resource. For example: v1alpha1, v1beta2, etc.
- `kind` (required): Kind of the resource. For example: ConfigMap, Secret, etc.
- `resource` (required): For example: configmaps, secrets, etc.
- `name`: If specified, only resources with this name will be considered.
- `namespace`: If specified, only resources in this namespace will be considered. Otherwise, all namespaces will be qualified.
- `selector`: If specified, resources with matching label selectors will be considered. Otherwise, any labels will be qualified.
- `onCreateOrUpdate`: If true workflow will be triggered when specified resource is created or, updated.
- `onDelete`: If true workflow will be triggered when specified resource is deleted. Note that, you should set at least one of `onCreateOrUpdate` and `onDelete` to true.
- `envFromPath`: Task containers might need some information about the resource for which the workflow was triggered. Those can be make available to task containers by means of environment variables. Using `envFromPath` you can specify a set of key value pairs indicating which json-path data to be mapped to which environment variable.

For example, let's say your workflow is triggered for following configmap:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-config
  namespace: default
data:
  example.property.1: hello
  example.property.2: world
```

And you have specified following `envFromPath`:

```yaml
envFromPath:
  DATA_ONE: '{$.data.example\.property\.1}'
```

In this case, all containers will have `DATA_ONE` environment variable with value `hello`.

### spec.steps

Specifies a set of tasks which will be executed in serial or, parallel order. A step can have following fields:

- `name`: An unique name across the workflow steps.
- `image`: Container image for the task.
- `commands`: Set of commands to be executed.
- `args`: Set of arguments to the commands.
- `requires`: Set of step-names which required to be completed before running this step. It should only be specified when `spec.executionOrder` is `DAG`.
- `volumeMounts`: Workflow volumes (specified in `workflow.spec.volumes`) to mount into the container's filesystem. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#volumemount-v1-core).
- `securityContext`: Specifies security context for the container associated with this step. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.13/#securitycontext-v1-core).

### spec.template

- `name`: Name of the workflow template to be invoked.
- `arguments`: Set of key value pairs to be used as arguments to substitute template placeholders. For more details on substitution see [here](https://github.com/drone/docs/blob/v0.8.0/content/usage/config/substitution.md).

Note that, you can not specify `spec.steps` while using template.

### spec.executionOrder

Specifies the order in which the steps will be executed. Possible values are:

- `Serial`: Steps will be executed one by one in the given order.
- `Parallel`: All the steps will be executed simultaneously.
- `DAG`: Steps will be executed sequentially or, simultaneously based on dependency of each steps.

Note that, if nothing specified, `Serial` will be used as default execution order.

### spec.allowManualTrigger

When true, manual/fake trigger wil be allowed. See [here](/docs/guides/engine/basics/manual_trigger.md) for more details about how to perform this.

### spec.serviceAccount

Name of the service-account to ensure RBAC for the workflow. This service-account along with operator's service-account must have `list` and `watch` permissions for the resources specified in `spec.triggers`. This service-account is also used to run all pods associated with the workflow.

### spec.envVar

List of environment variables to set in all task containers. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#envvar-v1-core).

### spec.envFrom

List of sources to populate environment variables in all task containers. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#envfromsource-v1-core).

### spec.volumes

List of volumes that can be mounted by the task containers belonging to the workflow. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#volume-v1-core).

### spec.securityContext

Specifies security context for all pods associated with this workflow. For more details see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.13/#podsecuritycontext-v1-core).

### spec.nodeSelector

Specifies NodeSelector for all pods associated with this workflow. It is a selector which must be true for the pods to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pods to be scheduled on that node.

### spec.schedulerName

Specifies SchedulerName for all pods associated with this workflow. If specified, all pods will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, all pods will be dispatched by default scheduler.

### spec.tolerations

Specifies tolerations for all pods associated with this workflow.

### spec.resources

Specifies resource requirements for all the step containers associated with this workflow.
